    "weekly_overview": "During the week of 8–14 August 2025 the sovereign‑debt landscape was dominated by rating actions, restructuring milestones and debates about equitable burdens. S&P’s upgrade of India to BBB and Moody’s upgrade of Pakistan to Caa1 underscored confidence in fiscal consolidation and macro‑economic resilience. Sri Lanka reported that over 90 percent of its public external debt restructuring was implemented, while Ghana faced renewed calls for fiscal discipline and completion of debt negotiations. Zambia’s central bank held its policy rate amid inflation and restructuring delays. Malawi’s debt distress intensified, with large arrears to commercial creditors and hidden liabilities in the energy sector. Debt Justice research highlighted that private creditors receive the largest share of low‑income countries’ payments, fuelling calls for legal reforms. Articles also scrutinised the inadequacy of current macro‑fiscal frameworks for climate‑resilient investments and advocated for a Borrowers’ Club. Across regions, investors remained cautious, as reflected in Ukraine’s distressed bond pricing, while Angola considered a cautious return to Eurobond markets.\n",

    "trend_analysis": "Rating upgrades for India and Pakistan contrasted with deepening distress in Malawi and cautious outlooks for Ghana and Zambia. Sovereign restructurings are advancing (Sri Lanka, Malawi) but continue to expose hidden liabilities and systemic risks. Private creditors’ dominance in debt servicing and the emergence of climate and trade‑finance considerations highlight the need for innovative instruments and stronger legal frameworks. Markets remain sensitive to geopolitical events, with Ukraine’s bonds illustrating that political developments quickly feed into sovereign risk pricing."

They pointed out that members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and V20 have suffered more than US$525 billion in losses – around 20 percent of their combined GDP – from climate‑related shocks. The commentary called on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to update debt sustainability analyses to account for resilience benefits and to scale up adaptation financing. Without integrating climate‑resilient debt clauses and recognising adaptation as an investment, the authors warned that debt sustainability metrics will continue to discourage necessary climate‑proofing in vulnerable economies【924955580626843†L50-L103】.",
