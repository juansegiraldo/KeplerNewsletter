            <h2>Weekly Summary</h2>
            <p>During the week from 16 to 22 August 2025, sovereign‑debt markets were shaped by rating actions, ongoing restructurings and innovative financing mechanisms. Fitch affirmed several sovereign‑linked entities – including <strong>Germany</strong>’s KfW, <strong>Romania</strong>, <strong>New Zealand</strong> and <strong>Iceland</strong> – highlighting strong policy frameworks but warning of high twin deficits, delayed consolidation and external vulnerabilities. S&P reaffirmed the US ‘AA+’ rating, noting that tariff revenues could offset deficits as national debt exceeds US$37 trillion. Africa remained in focus: <strong>Ghana</strong> paid US$708.1 million in coupons under its domestic debt exchange, secured a draft US$5.4 billion bilateral restructuring, and saw its domestic swap saving 61 billion cedi and boosting growth. <strong>Zambia</strong> continued implementing its G20 Common Framework deal, but low tax revenues and governance issues impede progress. <strong>Kenya</strong> explored buying back short‑term local bonds to ease looming maturities, while <strong>Cameroon</strong> authorised CFA 930 billion in borrowing despite IMF warnings. Fitch’s analysis of Mexican banks assessed a new trust fund to support PEMEX as credit‑neutral, and commentary on an <strong>Armenia</strong>–<strong>Azerbaijan</strong> peace framework noted potential credit benefits but cautioned timelines. Overall, rating agencies emphasised credible fiscal anchors, but high debt burdens and complex restructurings continue to challenge sovereigns.</p>

                <div class="item-content">
                    Fitch Ratings said the Mexican government’s plan to ease Petróleos Mexicanos’ (PEMEX) financial pressure is credit‑neutral for commercial banks. A new trust fund called Eagle Funding issued US$12 billion of pre‑capitalised notes to refinance expensive debt, and a MXN 250 billion (about US$13 billion) investment vehicle financed by commercial banks, development banks and the pension fund AFORE will underpin a long‑term capital injection. Fitch notes that the seven largest Mexican banks’ exposure to the public sector is about 26 % of assets and that the trust fund reduces refinancing risk without increasing credit risk. By shifting obligations off banks’ balance sheets and extending maturities, the scheme stabilises PEMEX’s debt while preserving bank capital. Further monitoring will assess the trust’s performance and any additional government guarantees.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Fitch affirmed Romania’s long‑term foreign‑currency issuer rating at ‘BBB‑’ and kept the outlook negative. The agency said the rating reflects EU membership and strong capital inflows but is constrained by weak public finances, large fiscal deficits and rising debt‑to‑GDP ratios. Fitch projects the budget deficit to remain about 4.7 % of GDP in 2025 and warns that political polarisation and delays in fiscal consolidation undermine confidence. Public debt is expected to continue rising from a moderate base, and the negative outlook signals that further slippage could trigger a downgrade. Next milestones include the government’s ability to pass reforms under EU fiscal rules and to curb primary deficits.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Zambia defaulted on its debt in 2020 when public liabilities reached 103.5 % of GDP and has since negotiated a restructuring of US$6.3 billion in bilateral debt under the G20 Common Framework. The deal stretches maturities to 2043 and fixes interest at 1 % until 2037, offering substantial cash‑flow relief. While the agreement covers official creditors, private bondholders – who hold a significant share of Zambia’s external debt – have not yet signed comparable terms. Fitch notes that Zambia’s tax‑to‑GDP ratio remains low (16.8 %), and governance challenges persist, limiting revenue mobilisation. The IMF’s next review will assess whether fiscal reforms and diversification strategies (such as agriculture) can support debt sustainability. Securing private‑creditor participation and improving tax collection are key milestones.

                    FurtherAfrica reports that Ghana’s domestic debt exchange programme, completed in late 2023, saved around 61 billion cedi and paved the way for a modest economic rebound. The swap involved converting high‑coupon domestic bonds into longer‑maturity instruments with lower yields, easing cash‑flow pressures and helping Ghana achieve 5.3 % year‑on‑year GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025. The article notes that Ghana has secured a draft US$5.4 billion bilateral debt restructuring under the G20 Common Framework, but a dispute with Afreximbank over a US$750 million loan complicates progress. Legislative reforms and penalties for extra‑budgetary spending have restored some market confidence, yet the country still faces high inflation and currency volatility. Next steps include finalising agreements with commercial creditors and implementing fiscal reforms under the IMF programme.

                    S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed the United States’ long‑term sovereign rating at ‘AA+’ with a stable outlook, noting that revenue from President Donald Trump’s tariffs could help offset the fiscal impact of a US$3.3 trillion tax‑and‑spending bill. Primary analyst Lisa Schineller said future rating actions will hinge on how budget execution and tariff receipts affect growth and deficits. Analysts estimate the bill could add US$3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, while U.S. national debt has already surpassed US$37 trillion and the effective tariff rate may reach 18.6 %. S&P cautioned that policy uncertainty remains high and that the benefits of tariffs depend on trade dynamics. The next milestone will be the release of federal budget updates and a review of tariff collection data.

                    The article notes that Ghana has secured a draft agreement with its official creditors to restructure US$5.4 billion of bilateral debt under the G20 Common Framework. The plan would reschedule payments due between December 2022 and December 2026, capitalising arrears and repaying them from 2039 to 2043. Interest rates on rescheduled amounts would range from 1 % to 3 %, substantially below market levels, providing debt‑service relief during Ghana’s IMF‑supported programme. However, private creditors hold about 43 % of Africa’s external debt and delays in achieving comparability of treatment could undermine the deal. The article also criticises the voluntary nature of the Common Framework, arguing that enforcement mechanisms are weak. Upcoming steps include finalising the memorandum of understanding with the official creditor committee and engaging private bondholders.

                    Financial Afrik reports that Ghana’s Treasury paid US$708.1 million in interest under its Domestic Debt Exchange Programme on 19 August, marking the fifth coupon payment since the programme began in 2023. The payment covers bonds issued after the domestic debt exchange and signals the government’s commitment to honour its restructured obligations. The successful payment follows previous delays and is expected to bolster investor confidence as Ghana continues to negotiate external debt relief. The government aims to maintain timely servicing to avoid triggering cross‑default clauses and to build credibility ahead of talks with private creditors.

KfW’s ratings are equalised with those of Germany (AAA/Stable/F1+) due to an explicit, direct and unconditional guarantee provided by the federal government and a maintenance obligation ensuring KfW’s continuation as an economic entity. Fitch notes that KfW’s important policy role, strong capitalisation and mandate to finance development projects underpin the rating. The stable outlook reflects expectations that sovereign support will continue and that KfW’s risk‑management practices will remain conservative. Future developments to watch include changes to Germany’s fiscal policy and any amendments to KfW’s guarantee framework.

The German bad‑bank vehicle’s ratings are equalised with those of the State of North Rhine‑Westphalia (NRW) and Germany because the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (FMSA) and NRW provide a deficiency guarantee ensuring that EAA can meet its liabilities even if other owners cannot. This guarantee, combined with a maintenance obligation that ensures EAA’s continuation, underpins the top rating. Fitch emphasises that EAA’s mandate is to wind down the assets of the former WestLB and that it is not intended to operate on a commercial basis. The stable outlook reflects continued state support and a gradual reduction of risk exposures. Upcoming milestones include monitoring progress on asset wind‑down and any legislative changes to the guarantee.

The agency projects fiscal consolidation to proceed slowly; the government plans to return to budget balance only by fiscal year 2029, leaving public debt above pre‑pandemic levels.

Upcoming developments include the government’s mid‑term fiscal update and monetary policy decisions by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which will influence debt dynamics.

The agency expects the fiscal deficit to narrow to 1.1 % of GDP by 2027. Iceland’s rating benefits from strong institutions and high per‑capita income but is constrained by a relatively small, volatile economy and lingering external imbalances.

The stable outlook reflects Fitch’s expectation of continued shareholder support and prudent management. Although Finnfund maintains a strong liquidity buffer and plays an important development role, its reliance on government capital means its creditworthiness mirrors that of the sovereign.

                    A Fitch Solutions report summarised by the Ghanaian Times warns that six Ghanaian banks face capital compliance challenges following the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme. Two banks remain undercapitalised despite receiving government support, and additional injections may be required before the end of 2025. The Bank of Ghana lowered the capital adequacy requirement from 13 % to 10 % and allowed losses on cedi bonds to be recognised over four years, which, together with high‑yield treasury investments and an appreciating currency, has helped the average capital adequacy ratio rise from 8.7 % in February 2024 to 18.2 % by mid‑2025. However, losses on Eurobond holdings must be recognised immediately, making foreign‑exchange exposure a key risk. Future milestones include the expiry of regulatory forbearance at year‑end and the completion of external debt restructuring.

                    Fitch Ratings noted that a peace framework between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be credit‑positive but is unlikely to impact ratings immediately. Sustained peace would reduce geopolitical risk, ease foreign‑exchange volatility and allow both countries to redirect resources from defence spending to growth‑enhancing investment. Fitch stresses that benefits would materialise over several years and depend on successful implementation of the agreement, which remains uncertain amid lingering tensions. The agency also points out that Armenia’s defence spending is projected to rise in the short term and that durable risk reduction is needed before ratings could be adjusted.

Nevertheless, the overall U.S. effective tariff rate remains around 16 %. The report suggests that elevated tariffs could influence trade flows and inflation, potentially affecting government revenue and debt dynamics. Fitch notes that compliance with USMCA rules of origin helps lower tariffs but warns that potential escalation of trade disputes could raise rates. The monitor provides context for assessing how trade policy interacts with fiscal sustainability. Future milestones include monitoring U.S. trade negotiations and any changes to tariff schedules.

                <div class="item-content">
                    A Fitch special report noted that Latin American central banks are at different stages of their monetary easing cycles, which has implications for sovereign borrowing costs and debt sustainability. Brazil had already cut rates in response to moderating inflation, while Mexico’s Banxico was expected to start easing soon, and Chile and Colombia were mid‑cycle. The divergence reflects varying inflation dynamics and fiscal conditions across the region. Fitch cautions that premature easing could undermine currency stability and complicate debt management, particularly for countries with high foreign‑currency debt. Policymakers must balance inflation control with growth support and coordinate fiscal and monetary policies. Future milestones include upcoming central bank meetings and fiscal policy announcements.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Fitch affirmed NRW.BANK’s long‑term issuer rating at ‘AAA’ with a stable outlook. Although the detailed report is behind a cookie wall, Fitch’s standard rationale for such ratings emphasises the guarantee framework provided by the state of North Rhine‑Westphalia and the German federal government, which ensures the bank can meet its obligations. NRW.BANK is mandated to support regional development rather than operate as a profit‑maximising institution, and its liabilities benefit from a maintenance obligation and statutory guarantee similar to that of KfW. The stable outlook reflects the expectation that sovereign support will continue. Key milestones include monitoring Germany’s fiscal stance and any changes to NRW.BANK’s statutory guarantee framework.
