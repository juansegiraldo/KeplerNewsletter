Notably, **Sri Lanka made strides in finalising its external debt overhaul** with bilateral agreements that push payments far into the future, while **Ghana recommenced servicing restructured Eurobond coupons** and resumed domestic debt auctions, signalling regained stability:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. **Zambia’s IMF-supported programme remained on track**, securing a fresh disbursement and eyeing extension to consolidate debt sustainability gains:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. In contrast, **activist pressure mounted for systemic fixes**, as delays in cases like Ethiopia’s creditor talks and South Sudan’s litigation underscored the limitations of current frameworks:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Meanwhile, **credit rating actions highlighted divergent fiscal trajectories**: Kenya and Oman received upgrades for improving liquidity and debt metrics:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}, whereas Fitch’s downgrade of China reflected mounting debt risks:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. **Climate-linked instruments** continued to gain attention, though Grenada’s hurricane clause remained untriggered. Looking ahead, observers will monitor **election outcomes (e.g. Bolivia) and policy shifts** that could determine whether countries secure relief or face rising default risks. Overall, the week’s themes included the **push for inclusive debt restructurings, the impact of reforms on creditworthiness, and the persistent calls for innovation in sovereign debt governance**.",

The week illustrated a **two-track trend**: countries like Ghana, Kenya and Oman are restoring stability through restructurings or fiscal discipline, while others like Ethiopia and South Sudan continue to grapple with holdout creditors and legal challenges. There is a growing **momentum for new debt mechanisms** as civil society voices highlight systemic shortfalls. Overall, a pattern of **rewarding reformist momentum versus penalising inertia** is evident in sovereign risk pricing and ratings."

The one-notch uplift comes as Argentina has stabilized its finances in recent months – inflation, while still high, has decelerated from triple digits, and international reserves have stopped falling thanks to a more market-driven peso. Fitch noted that Argentina’s near-term external debt payments are largely covered by the IMF’s disbursements and a 2024 bond buyback operation, which **alleviates short-term liquidity pressure**. The outlook remains constrained by Argentina’s still-fragile reserve buffer and political uncertainty ahead of the October 2025 general election. **Further rating improvement is contingent on continued adherence to the IMF fiscal targets** (zero primary deficit this year) and successful liability management to push out maturities. Nonetheless, the upgrade reflects a modestly more optimistic view that Argentina can avoid another hard default in the next 12–18 months, provided the policy path stays on course. Fitch also pointed to the **recent $1 billion local-currency bond issuance** as evidence of returning investor confidence. Argentina’s rating is still deeply speculative, but this marks the first step upward since its 2020 default, aligning Fitch with S&P (CCC+) in rating Argentina’s creditworthiness.",
