            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>This week’s sovereign&#8209;debt pulse centred on IMF programmes and restructuring milestones. Cameroon, Ghana and Malawi secured disbursements or completed reviews under IMF facilities, while Sri Lanka’s staff mission noted progress but urged a timely completion of its debt deal. Ghana’s mid‑year budget review showed fiscal improvement and the country signed bilateral debt agreements under the G20 Common Framework. Senegal’s hidden debt saga deepened, prompting calls for an IMF waiver, and Kenya explored Panda and Sukuk bonds amid stalled IMF support. A commentary questioned the efficacy of debt‑for‑nature swaps. Looking ahead, attention will focus on Senegal’s recovery plan, Ghana’s negotiations with commercial creditors and Sri Lanka’s remaining bilateral agreements.</p>

                    The IMF’s Executive Board approved the eighth reviews of Cameroon’s Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility and the third review of its Resilience and Sustainability Facility, unlocking about US$75.7 million and US$71 million respectively. Directors noted that Cameroon remains at high risk of debt distress but judged debt sustainable; they urged higher non‑oil revenue, improved public investment management, stronger governance and arrears clearance【701204150823020†L250-L330】. The review emphasised preserving debt sustainability and advancing reforms to boost climate‑resilient spending. Continued fiscal consolidation, financial sector reforms and anti‑corruption measures are expected to underpin economic recovery and open the door to further disbursements under the programme【701204150823020†L250-L330】.

                    Completing its fourth review of Ghana’s 36‑month Extended Credit Facility, the IMF disbursed about US$367 million and assessed that growth and the external position have improved despite pre‑election fiscal slippages. The government adopted corrective measures and aims for a 2025 primary surplus of 1.5 % of GDP【980793405610472†L250-L333】. Ghana has signed a memorandum of understanding with its Official Creditor Committee and is negotiating with commercial creditors under NDAs; finishing these talks is critical to restoring debt sustainability【980793405610472†L320-L352】. Directors stressed continued revenue mobilisation, reform of state‑owned enterprises, tight monetary policy and financial sector stability【980793405610472†L250-L333】.

                    The IMF’s 2025 Article IV consultation found Malawi struggling with low growth, high inflation and unsustainable debt: public liabilities reached about 88 % of GDP and interest payments equalled roughly 7 % of GDP【341289864032811†L257-L319】. Directors urged decisive policy action, recommending fiscal consolidation, improved revenue mobilisation and tighter expenditure control to stabilise the economy【341289864032811†L295-L319】. They stressed that completing external debt restructuring and moving to a unified, market‑determined exchange rate are essential for restoring debt sustainability【341289864032811†L295-L319】. The Board also called for governance reforms and stronger anti‑money‑laundering frameworks【341289864032811†L257-L319】.

                    An IMF staff mission reported that Sri Lanka’s reforms are yielding results: GDP grew 4.8 % in the first quarter of 2025, inflation turned negative at −1.1 % in June and reserves rose to about US$6 billion【839234572267749†L260-L312】. To maintain debt sustainability, the mission said the authorities must achieve a primary surplus of 2.3 % of GDP in 2026, broaden the tax base, rationalise spending and implement cost‑recovery energy pricing【839234572267749†L260-L312】.

                    A Reuters explainer revealed that audits ordered by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye uncovered billions of dollars of off‑books borrowing. A Court of Auditors review raised Senegal’s end‑2023 debt to 99.7 % of GDP, implying about US$7 billion of hidden debt【830935877612211†L188-L193】. Provisional figures for end‑2024 suggested debt could reach 119 % of GDP, while S&P estimated the shortfall at around US$13 billion【830935877612211†L195-L205】. The IMF has frozen its US$1.8 billion credit facility and must grant a waiver for misreporting before a new programme can be negotiated【830935877612211†L175-L229】. Options include rebasing the economy or reprofiling debt to lower the ratio【830935877612211†L247-L268】. Prime Minister Sonko’s forthcoming economic recovery plan will be closely watched【830935877612211†L248-L254】.

                    In his mid‑year budget review, Finance Minister Cassiel Ato Forson reported that Ghana’s fiscal deficit for the first half of 2025 was 1.1 % of GDP, well below the 2.4 % target, and revised the full‑year deficit target to 3.8 %【963290936772608†L165-L176】. Growth accelerated to 5.3 % year‑on‑year in the first quarter and inflation fell to 13.7 % in June【963290936772608†L165-L176】. Revenue and grants were slightly below target but expenditure undershot by 14 %, reflecting reduced borrowing and strong expenditure control【963290936772608†L171-L190】. Complementary analysis noted a primary surplus of 1.1 % of GDP, a cedi appreciation of over 42 % and reserves around US$11 billion; debt restructuring lowered the debt‑to‑GDP ratio to roughly 85 % and Fitch upgraded Ghana’s rating【932634435019823†L151-L198】. Risks include revenue shortfalls and wage pressures【963290936772608†L179-L192】.

                    Ghana formalised bilateral debt relief agreements with France and other members of its Official Creditor Committee under the G20 Common Framework after parliament approved indicative terms【969804105246464†L71-L95】. The deals, which restructure around US$5.4 billion in bilateral debt, follow a memorandum of understanding signed in January and are expected to create fiscal breathing space while aligning repayment terms with Ghana’s IMF programme【969804105246464†L71-L95】. Finance Minister Cassiel Ato Forson said more agreements would soon follow and confirmed that discussions with commercial bondholders are ongoing under non‑disclosure agreements【762001010087985†L72-L100】. The government pledged transparency and insisted that the agreements do not compromise sovereignty【969804105246464†L71-L95】.

                <div class="item-content">
                    In a critical commentary, OMFIF analysed recent debt‑for‑nature and similar swaps in Belize, Ecuador, Gabon and Côte d’Ivoire and concluded that such deals have delivered negligible debt relief. The authors found that the swaps provided average savings of just 0.8 % of GDP, with high transaction costs eating into the benefits【692542579004139†L120-L276】. They argued that debt swaps are suitable only for countries with moderate distress and do little to improve debt sustainability【692542579004139†L120-L276】. Instead, comprehensive restructurings and targeted concessional finance for climate adaptation are needed【692542579004139†L120-L276】. The commentary warned investors against overstating the developmental impact of these instruments.

                <div class="item-content">
                    AfroNomicsLaw reported that Kenya plans to issue its first Panda bond in China to raise about US$2.77 billion to finance the Standard Gauge Railway and diversify funding away from costly Eurobonds【282959201638471†L48-L93】. The government is also exploring Sukuk and Samurai bonds; this diversification comes as Kenya struggles to access global markets after missing IMF programme benchmarks in March, forfeiting around US$850 million in budget support【282959201638471†L48-L93】. Protest‑led political unrest has heightened risks, and observers say debt sustainability depends on restoring fiscal discipline and resuming IMF support【282959201638471†L48-L93】. Diversifying into local‑currency instruments could mitigate currency risk but will require careful market development.

                    Norvanreports ranked African countries by outstanding IMF credit as of 21 July 2025. Egypt leads with about US$7.4 billion owed, followed by Côte d’Ivoire (US$3.1 billion), Kenya (US$3.0 billion), Angola (US$2.7 billion) and Ghana (US$2.7 billion)【103733815381409†L103-L163】.

                <div class="item-content">
                    As part of expenditure control under its IMF programme, Ghana has informed the Fund that public‑sector wage increases will be capped at 10 % in 2025, according to Adomonline. The wage bill is projected to exceed US$7 billion and account for over 30 % of revenue, underscoring the need for discipline【645674416461161†L133-L169】. The government also plans to rationalise spending on goods and services, limit hiring and audit domestic arrears to reduce fiscal pressures【645674416461161†L133-L169】. Implementing these measures will require negotiations with labour unions but is seen as essential for sustaining debt sustainability and freeing resources for social and growth‑enhancing spending【645674416461161†L133-L169】.
