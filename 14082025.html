            <h2>Weekly Summary</h2>
            <p>During the week of 8–14 August 2025 the sovereign‑debt landscape was dominated by rating actions, restructuring milestones and debates about equitable burdens. S&P’s upgrade of India to BBB and Moody’s upgrade of Pakistan to Caa1 underscored confidence in fiscal consolidation and macro‑economic resilience. Sri Lanka reported that over 90 percent of its public external debt restructuring was implemented, while Ghana faced renewed calls for fiscal discipline and completion of debt negotiations. Zambia’s central bank held its policy rate amid inflation and restructuring delays. Malawi’s debt distress intensified, with large arrears to commercial creditors and hidden liabilities in the energy sector. Debt Justice research highlighted that private creditors receive the largest share of low‑income countries’ payments, fuelling calls for legal reforms. Articles also scrutinised the inadequacy of current macro‑fiscal frameworks for climate‑resilient investments and advocated for a Borrowers’ Club. Across regions, investors remained cautious, as reflected in Ukraine’s distressed bond pricing, while Angola considered a cautious return to Eurobond markets.</p>

                <div class="item-meta">Zambia — 13-08-2025 — Reuters</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    Zambia’s Monetary Policy Committee maintained the benchmark lending rate at 14.5 percent, resisting market expectations for a cut. The committee highlighted that inflation decelerated to 13 percent in July but warned of continued upward pressure from the depreciation of the kwacha and food prices. The decision comes as the country’s debt restructuring negotiations have dragged on longer than anticipated. Zambia is trying to finalise deals with official and private creditors under the G20 Common Framework following its 2020 default. The central bank signalled that monetary policy would stay tight until inflation expectations are anchored, and it urged fiscal authorities to expedite the restructuring to restore macro‑economic stability. Market participants noted that prolonged negotiations are dampening investor confidence.

                <div class="item-meta">Ukraine — 14-08-2025 — Reuters</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    Ukrainian sovereign bonds rallied to around 55 cents on the dollar after Washington and Moscow announced a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, but investors viewed the meeting as largely symbolic. Analysts noted that prices still implied a deep restructuring with limited expectations of debt relief. The rally reflected a tactical trade rather than a reassessment of long‑term fundamentals. Market participants caution that without meaningful progress on resolving the conflict and securing sustained international financial support, Ukraine’s debt trajectory remains unsustainable. The article underscores how geopolitical events temporarily influence distressed debt prices but do not alter structural debt sustainability issues.

                <div class="item-meta">GLOBAL — 08-08-2025 — Al Jazeera</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    Opinion writers argued that low‑income countries should form a ‘Borrowers’ Club’ to counterbalance creditor coordination failures. They noted that in 2023 low‑income countries paid a record US$96.2 billion in external debt service, with interest costs surging to US$34.6 billion. More than half of these countries are in or near debt distress. The authors criticised the G20’s Common Framework, which has been used by only a handful of countries, and called for collective action to push for deeper haircuts, fair comparability of treatment and state‑contingent instruments. They argued that debtor solidarity could enable unified negotiating positions and accelerate progress on systemic reforms.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Debt Justice research showed that between 2020 and 2025 low‑income countries allocated 39 percent of their external debt payments – about US$354 billion – to private lenders, compared with 34 percent to multilateral institutions and just 13 percent to Chinese lenders. The organisation argued that private bondholders and commodity traders were receiving outsized payments while obstructing restructurings in countries such as Chad, Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana and South Sudan. Malawi recently defaulted on loans to Afreximbank and the Trade and Development Bank (TDB). Debt Justice called for legislation to compel private creditors to participate in relief and proposed legal reforms to ensure fair comparability of treatment across creditor classes.

                <div class="item-meta">Zambia — 11-08-2025 — Insurance Journal (Bloomberg)</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    The African trade‑finance lender Trade and Development Bank (TDB) is exploring an insurance claim via a Lloyd’s of London syndicate after Zambia included TDB loans in its sovereign debt restructuring, a move that trade finance lenders say could set a precedent. TDB has US$872 million exposure to Zambia, of which US$348 million is insured. Chief executive Admassu Tadesse warned that including trade‑credit claims in sovereign restructurings could jeopardise private trade finance across Africa and lead to higher premiums. The International Monetary Fund expects institutions like TDB and Afreximbank to contribute to Malawi’s restructuring, while negotiations continue for a new round of talks with Zambia. The case underscores the blurred lines between commercial and sovereign debt and the need for clarity on the treatment of trade‑finance obligations.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Malawi’s 2025 IMF/World Bank debt sustainability analysis revealed that arrears to external commercial creditors exceed US$669 million and that the country’s total public debt stands at 88 percent of GDP. Interest payments are projected to rise to 8 percent of GDP in 2025/26 and could exceed 40 percent of government revenue by 2026, crowding out essential expenditure. The analysis classifies Malawi’s debt as ‘in distress’ and recommends a primary fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2024/25, followed by a medium‑term surplus of 2 percent to stabilise debt. Economists warn that if arrears continue accumulating, Malawi’s creditworthiness will deteriorate further, making future debt relief harder to secure.

                <div class="item-content">
                    Malawi’s Energy Regulatory Authority owes more than K950 billion (approximately US$650 million) to Petroleum Importers Limited and the National Oil Company of Malawi due to losses accumulated from fuel imports. The debt was supposed to be funded through the Price Stabilisation Fund, but the fund is now empty. The IMF confirmed that the fund’s depletion places additional fiscal pressure on the government, and officials warn that fuel shortages and pump price increases are imminent. Analysts highlight that the accumulation of off‑balance‑sheet liabilities in the energy sector is aggravating Malawi’s already precarious debt position and could complicate ongoing restructuring talks.

                    S&P Global Ratings upgraded India’s sovereign credit rating from BBB‑ to BBB, citing credible fiscal consolidation, robust macro‑economic fundamentals and a positive medium‑term growth outlook. The rating upgrade led to a decline in government bond yields and strengthened the rupee, easing borrowing costs for corporates. The ratings agency noted that India’s policy reforms and improved debt trajectory bring it on par with Indonesia and Mexico. Economists said the upgrade should reduce the credit premium on Indian debt, encourage foreign portfolio flows and support corporate borrowing. The announcement followed the finance ministry’s commitment to fiscal discipline and structural reforms.

They noted that lower deficits and structural reforms bolstered debt sustainability and investor confidence. However, commentators cautioned that external risks, including higher U.S. tariffs and global economic volatility, could test India’s resilience. Financial markets responded positively, but analysts warned that further reforms are needed to sustain growth and maintain the fiscal discipline that drove the upgrade.

                    Indian economists and officials applauded S&P’s upgrade from BBB‑ to BBB, describing it as overdue given India’s strong macro‑economic fundamentals. They attributed the move to high infrastructure investment, disciplined fiscal management and policy continuity under the government. Officials emphasised that the stable outlook is anchored by inclusive development and resilient growth. Analysts said the upgrade would boost investor confidence, attract greater foreign inflows, reduce bond yields and lower borrowing costs for both sovereign and corporate issuers. Some experts noted that further reforms and sustained fiscal discipline are required to maintain the improved rating.

                    A World Bank economic update on Ghana emphasised that the country’s medium‑term growth prospects hinge on completing external debt restructuring and implementing stabilisation reforms. The report urged authorities to entrench fiscal discipline, reduce liabilities of state‑owned enterprises, contain inflation and exchange‑rate volatility, and build resilience to external shocks. Without these measures, the economy could struggle to regain momentum after recent domestic and external shocks. The update underscores that debt sustainability is not solely about restructuring but requires consistent fiscal and monetary policy coordination.

Despite the improvement, Deloitte cautioned authorities not to rush back into international capital markets, warning that new foreign borrowing could erode the hard‑won gains. The firm recommended strengthening cash buffers through the sinking fund and moderating foreign borrowing to avoid piling up debts during the recovery phase.

Moody’s noted that debt affordability has strengthened but remains weak, and that the upgrade applies to Pakistan’s global Sukuk programmes.

                    A market analysis noted that Angola’s debt‑to‑GDP ratio declined to 62 percent in 2024 from 71 percent previously, thanks to economic diversification and high oil prices. The government recovered US$200 million in collateral previously posted with JPMorgan, providing breathing space ahead of a US$864 million Eurobond payment due in November. Angola’s 2029 dollar bonds rallied to 93.25 cents on the dollar, yielding around 10 percent, but analysts said the country was unlikely to issue new Eurobonds in 2025 unless borrowing costs fall further. The cautious stance reflects lessons from past borrowing cycles and a desire to maintain debt sustainability.

                    Authors argued that current macro‑fiscal frameworks treat climate adaptation investments as costs rather than productivity‑enhancing expenditures. They pointed out that members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and V20 have suffered more than US$525 billion in losses – around 20 percent of their combined GDP – from climate‑related shocks. The commentary called on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to update debt sustainability analyses to account for resilience benefits and to scale up adaptation financing. Without integrating climate‑resilient debt clauses and recognising adaptation as an investment, the authors warned that debt sustainability metrics will continue to discourage necessary climate‑proofing in vulnerable economies.

                <div class="item-meta">Malawi — 14-08-2025 — The Nation (Malawi)</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    The Reserve Bank of Malawi disclosed that it has negotiated revised repayment terms with Afreximbank and the Trade and Development Bank, allowing repayments in local currency to ease pressure on foreign reserves. The International Monetary Fund expects Afreximbank and TDB to provide debt relief to Malawi, but Afreximbank has so far refused to join restructuring negotiations. Malawi’s arrears to commercial creditors have damaged the country’s creditworthiness and complicated talks. Economists warn that without broader creditor participation, including regional development banks, Malawi’s restructuring could fail to achieve debt sustainability and restore market access.

                <div class="item-meta">Malawi — 11-08-2025 — Insurance Journal (Bloomberg)</div>
                <div class="item-content">
                    The Trade and Development Bank’s total exposure to Malawi stands at US$530 million, of which US$214 million is insured, while its exposure to Ethiopia totals US$638 million. These figures, disclosed by TDB during discussions on Zambia’s debt restructuring, highlight the systemic risks posed by including trade‑finance credits in sovereign restructuring deals. TDB warns that forcing trade‑finance lenders to take losses could raise borrowing costs across Africa and deter banks from providing critical trade finance. The episode underscores the need for clarity on how trade credit should be treated in future sovereign debt workouts and may spur development of insurance products or legal frameworks to protect trade‑finance exposures.
